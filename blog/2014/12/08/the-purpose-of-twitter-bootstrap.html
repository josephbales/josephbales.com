    <p>Okay, so I rarely make websites or blog anymore. I’ll admit that I’ve fallen a bit out of touch with regard to the latest and greatest web technologies. But I’ve surprised even myself in the amount of time it has taken for me to understand <a title="Twitter Bootstrap" href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>.</p>

<p>In case you didn’t know, Bootstrap is a web framework. No, I wouldn’t go that far. It’s more like a web layout framework. Bootstrap helps take your dowdy, old site and make it look like something a professional web designer might throw together in an afternoon (this is a compliment to web designers from someone who couldn’t design their way out of a wet paper bag).</p>

<p>So the thing that has really eluded me when it comes to Bootstrap is the power. What power is this? What power could there possibly be in a glorified style sheet?</p>

<p>The power comes not from what Bootstrap does, it comes from what I don’t have to do (and this is the part that took me so long to figure out). I don’t have to write style sheets anymore. That’s it.  But whoa, THAT’S IT! I used to spend HOURS (days even) tweaking this and nudging that, opening the <a title="The Gimp!" href="http://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">Gimp</a> and doing a little on the fly editing, reading <a title="Pretentious" href="http://alistapart.com/" target="_blank">A List Apart</a> and <a title="Nerd cred quantified." href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>

<p>Now when I build a site I vow to do as little of that crap as possible. Now I’m going to use Bootstrap for what it was intended: to leave the style to designers and let the blogger/developer blog and develop.</p>
